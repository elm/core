-- MATHEMATICS


{-| An `Int` is a whole number. Valid syntax for integers includes:

    0
    42
    9000
    0xFF   -- 255 in hexidecimal
    0x000A --  10 in hexidecimal

**Note:** `Int` math is well-defined in the range `-2^31` to `2^31 - 1`. Outside
of that range, the behavior is determined by the compilation target. When
generating JavaScript, the safe range expands to `-2^53` to `2^53 - 1` for some
operations, but if we generate WebAssembly some day, we would do the traditional
[integer overflow][io]. This quirk is necessary to get good performance on
quirky compilation targets.

**Historical Note:** The name `Int` comes from the term [integer][]. It appears
that the `int` abbreviation was introduced in [ALGOL 68][68], shortening it
from `integer` in [ALGOL 60][60]. Today, almost all programming languages use
this abbreviation.

[68]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_68
-}
type Int = Int -- NOTE: The compiler provides the real implementation.


{-| A `Float` is a [floating-point number][fp]. Valid syntax for floats includes:

    0
    42
    3.14
    0.1234
    6.022e23   -- == (6.022 * 10^23)
    6.022e+23  -- == (6.022 * 10^23)
    1.602e−19  -- == (1.602 * 10^-19)
    1e3        -- == (1 * 10^3) == 1000

**Historical Note:** The particular details of floats (e.g. `NaN`) are
specified by [IEEE 754][ieee] which is literally hard-coded into almost all
CPUs in the world. That means if you think `NaN` is wierd, you must
successfully overtake Intel and AMD with a chip that is not backwards
compatible with any widely-used assembly language.

-}
type Float = Float -- NOTE: The compiler provides the real implementation.


{-| Add two numbers. The `number` type variable means this operation can be
specialized to `Int -> Int -> Int` or to `Float -> Float -> Float`. So you
can do things like this:

    3002 + 4004 == 7006  -- all ints
    3.14 + 3.14 == 6.28  -- all floats

You _cannot_ add an `Int` and a `Float` directly though. Use functions like
[toFloat](#toFloat) or [round](#round) to convert both values to the same type.
So if you needed to add a list length to a `Float` for some reason, you
could say one of these:

    3.14 + toFloat (List.length [1,2,3]) == 6.14
    round 3.14 + List.length [1,2,3]     == 6

**Note:** Languages like Java and JavaScript automatically convert `Int` values
to `Float` values when you mix and match. This can make it difficult to be sure
exactly what type of number you are dealing with. When you try to _infer_ these
conversions (as Scala does) it can be even more confusing. Elm has opted for a
design that makes all conversions explicit.

-}

-- EQUALITY


{-| Check if values are &ldquo;the same&rdquo;.

**Note:** Elm uses structural equality on tuples, records, and user-defined
union types. This means the values `(3, 4)` and `(3, 4)` are definitely equal.
This is not true in languages like JavaScript that use reference equality on
objects.

**Note:** Equality (in the Elm sense) is not possible for certain types. For
example, the functions `(\n -> n + 1)` and `(\n -> 1 + n)` are &ldquo;the
same&rdquo; but detecting this in general is [undecidable][]. In a future
release, the compiler will detect when `(==)` is used with problematic
types and provide a helpful error message. This will require quite serious
infrastructure work that makes sense to batch with another big project, so the
stopgap is to crash as quickly as possible. Problematic types include functions
and JavaScript values like `Json.Encode.Value` which could contain functions
if passed through a port.

{-| This helps you find the angle (in radians) to an `(x,y)` coordinate, but

This version takes `y/x` as its argument, so there is no way to know whether
the negative signs comes from the `y` or `x` value. So as we go counter-clockwise
around the origin from point `(1,1)` to `(1,-1)` to `(-1,-1)` to `(-1,1)` we do
not get angles that go in the full circle:

Notice that everything is between `pi/2` and `-pi/2`. That is pretty useless
for figuring out angles in any sort of visualization, so again, check out
[`atan2`](#atan2) instead!

-- FUNCTION HELPERS


{-| Function composition, passing results along in the suggested direction. For
example, the following code checks if the square root of a number is odd:

You can think of this operator as equivalent to the following:

    (g << f)  ==  (\x -> g (f x))

So our example expands out to something like this:

    \n -> not (isEven (sqrt n))
-}
composeL : (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)
composeL g f x =
  g (f x)


{-| Function composition, passing results along in the suggested direction. For
example, the following code checks if the square root of a number is odd:

    sqrt >> isEven >> not

This direction of function composition seems less pleasant than `(<<)` which
reads nicely in expressions like: `filter (not << isRegistered) students`
-}
composeR : (a -> b) -> (b -> c) -> (a -> c)
composeR f g x =
  g (f x)


{-| Saying `x |> f` is exactly the same as `f x`.

It is called the “pipe” operator because it lets you write “pipelined” code.
For example, say we have a `toRadians` function for turning user input in
degrees into radians. We can rewrite it like this:

    import Maybe
    import String

    -- BEFORE
    toRadians : String -> Float
    toRadians input =
      degrees (toFloat (Maybe.withDefault 0 (String.toInt input))

    -- AFTER
    toRadians : String -> Float
    toRadians input =
      input
        |> String.toInt
        |> Maybe.withDefault 0
        |> toFloat
        |> degrees

Once you get the hang of it, it can be quite nice! To get a better intuition,
I recommend trying to rewrite code that uses `x |> f` into code like `f x`
until there are no pipes left.

**Note:** The compiler rewrites this to normal function application, so `(|>)`
has no runtime overhead.

apR : a -> (a -> b) -> b
apR x f =
  f x


{-| Saying `f <| x` is exactly the same as `f x`.

It can help you avoid parentheses, which can be nice sometimes. For example:

    Maybe.withDefault 0 (String.toInt "123")

Can be written as:

    Maybe.withDefault 0 <| String.toInt "123"

**Note:** The compiler rewrites this to normal function application, so `(<|)`
has no runtime overhead.

apL : (a -> b) -> a -> b

{-| Given a value, returns exactly the same value. This is called
[the identity function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_function).
-}
identity : a -> a
identity x =
  x


{-| Create a function that *always* returns the same value. Useful with
functions like `map`:

    List.map (always 0) [1,2,3,4,5] == [0,0,0,0,0]

    -- List.map (\_ -> 0) [1,2,3,4,5] == [0,0,0,0,0]
    -- always = (\x _ -> x)
-}
always : a -> b -> a
always a _ =
  a


{-| A value that can never happen! For context:

  - The boolean type `Bool` has two values: `True` and `False`
  - The unit type `()` has one value: `()`
  - The never type `Never` has no values!

You may see it in the wild in `Html Never` which means this HTML will never
produce any messages. You would need to write an event handler like
`onClick ??? : Attribute Never` but how can we fill in the question marks?!
So there cannot be any event handlers on that HTML.

You may also see this used with tasks that never fail, like `Task Never ()`.

The `Never` type is useful for restricting *arguments* to a function. Maybe my
API can only accept HTML without event handlers, so I require `Html Never` and
users can give `Html msg` and everything will go fine. Generally speaking, you
do not want `Never` in your return types though.
-}
type Never = JustOneMore Never


{-| A function that can never be called. Seems extremely pointless, but it
*can* come in handy. Imagine you have some HTML that should never produce any
messages. And say you want to use it in some other HTML that *does* produce
messages. You could say:

    import Html exposing (..)

    embedHtml : Html Never -> Html msg
    embedHtml staticStuff =
      div []
        [ text "hello"
        , Html.map never staticStuff
        ]

So the `never` function is basically telling the type system, make sure no one
ever calls me!

never : Never -> a
never (JustOneMore nvr) =
  never nvr
