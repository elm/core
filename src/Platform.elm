## Effect Manager Helpers

An extremely tiny portion of library authors should ever write effect managers.
Fundamentally, Elm needs maybe 10 of them total. I get that people are smart,
curious, etc. but that is not a substitute for a legitimate reason to make an
effect manager. Do you have an *organic need* this fills? Or are you just
curious? Public discussions of your explorations should be framed accordingly.

-- PROGRAMS


{-| A `Program` describes an Elm program! How does it react to input? Does it
show anything on screen? Etc.
-}
type Program flags model msg = Program


{-| Create a [headless][] program with no user interface.

This is great if you want to use Elm as the &ldquo;brain&rdquo; for something
else. For example, you could send messages out ports to modify the DOM, but do
all the complex logic in Elm.

[headless]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_software

Initializing a headless program from JavaScript looks like this:

```javascript
var app = Elm.MyThing.worker();
```

If _do_ want to control the user interface in Elm, the [`Browser`][browser]
module has a few ways to create that kind of `Program` instead!

-- TASKS and PROCESSES


{-| Head over to the documentation for the [`Task`](Task) module for more
information on this. It is only defined here because it is a platform
primitive.

{-| Head over to the documentation for the [`Process`](Process) module for
information on this. It is only defined here because it is a platform
primitive.

-- EFFECT MANAGER INTERNALS


{-| An effect manager has access to a “router” that routes messages between
the main app and your individual effect manager.
-}
type Router appMsg selfMsg =
  Router


{-| Send the router a message for the main loop of your app. This message will
be handled by the overall `update` function, just like events from `Html`.
-}
sendToApp : Router msg a -> msg -> Task x ()
sendToApp =
  Elm.Kernel.Platform.sendToApp


{-| Send the router a message for your effect manager. This message will
be routed to the `onSelfMsg` function, where you can update the state of your
effect manager as necessary.

As an example, the effect manager for web sockets
-}
sendToSelf : Router a msg -> msg -> Task x ()
sendToSelf =
  Elm.Kernel.Platform.sendToSelf
