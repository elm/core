{-| Every `Touch` has `xy` coordinates. It also has an identifier
`id` to distinguish one touch from another.

A touch also keeps info about the initial point and time of contact:
`x0`, `y0`, and `t0`. This helps compute more complicated gestures
like taps, drags, and swipes which need to know about timing or direction.
