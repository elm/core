{-| This library helps you generate pseudo-random values.

This library is all about building [`generators`](#Generator) for whatever
type of values you need. There are a bunch of primitive generators like
[`bool`](#bool) and [`int`](#int) that you can build up into fancier
generators with functions like [`list`](#list) and [`map`](#map).

It may be helpful to [read about JSON decoders][json] because they work very
similarly.

-- IMPLEMENTATION

{- Explanation of the PCG algorithm

    This is a special variation (dubbed RXS-M-SH) that produces 32
    bits of output by keeping 32 bits of state. There is one function
    (next) to derive the following state and another (peel) to obtain 32
    psuedo-random bits from the current state.

    Getting the next state is easy: multiply by a magic factor, and then add an
    increment. In this implementation, we're using a hard-coded, magic
    increment. This is a simplification from the 3rd party library, which
    carries the increment in the seed. If two seeds have different increments,
    their random numbers from the two seeds will never match up; they are
    completely independent. This is very helpful for isolated components or
    multithreading, and elm-test relies on this feature.

    Transforming a seed into 32 random bits is more complicated, but
    essentially you use the "most random" bits to pick some way of scrambling
    the remaining bits. Beyond that, see section 6.3.4 of the [paper].

    [paper](http://www.pcg-random.org/paper.html)

    Once we have 32 random bits, we have to turn it into a number. For integers,
    we first check if the range is a power of two. If it is, we can mask part of
    the value and be done. If not, we need to account for bias.

    Let's say you want a random number between 1 and 7 but I can only generate
    random numbers between 1 and 32. If I modulus by result by 7, I'm biased,
    because there are more random numbers that lead to 1 than 7. So instead, I
    check to see if my random number exceeds 28 (the largest multiple of 7 less
    than 32). If it does, I reroll, otherwise I mod by seven. This sounds
    wateful, except that instead of 32 it's 2^32, so in practice it's hard to
    notice. So that's how we get random ints. There's another process from
    floats, but I don't understand it very well.
-}


{-| A `Seed` is the source of randomness in the whole system. It hides the
current state of the random number generator.

Generators, not seeds, are the primary data structure for generating random
values. Generators are much easier to chain and combine than functions that take
and return seeds. Creating and managing seeds should happen "high up" in your
program.
-}
type Seed
    = Seed Int

-- step the RNG to produce the next seed
next : Seed -> Seed
next (Seed state0) =
    -- The magic constants are from Numerical Recipes and are inlined for perf.
    Seed (Bitwise.shiftRightZfBy 0 ((state0 * 1664525) + 1013904223))


-- obtain a psuedorandom 32-bit integer from a seed
peel : Seed -> Int
peel (Seed state) =
    -- This is the RXS-M-SH version of PCG, see section 6.3.4 of the paper
    -- and line 184 of pcg_variants.h in the 0.94 (non-minimal) C implementation,
    -- the latter of which is the source of the magic constant.
    let
        word =
            (Bitwise.xor state (Bitwise.shiftRightZfBy ((Bitwise.shiftRightZfBy 28 state) + 4) state)) * 277803737
    in
        Bitwise.shiftRightZfBy 0 (Bitwise.xor (Bitwise.shiftRightZfBy 22 word) word)


{-| A `Generator` is like a recipe for generating certain random values. So a
`Generator Int` describes how to generate integers and a `Generator String`
describes how to generate strings.

To actually *run* a generator and produce the random values, you need to use
either [`generate`](#generate), or [`step`](#step) and [`initialSeed`](#initialSeed).
-}
type Generator a =
    Generator (Seed -> (a, Seed))


{-| Generate a random value as specified by a given `Generator`, using a `Seed`
and returning a new one.

In the following example, we are trying to generate numbers between 0 and 100
with the `int 0 100` generator. Each time we call `step` we need to provide
a seed. This will produce a random number and a *new* seed to use if we want to
run other generators later.

    (x, seed1) = step (int 0 100) seed0
    (y, seed2) = step (int 0 100) seed1
    (z, seed3) = step (int 0 100) seed2
    [x, y, z] -- [85, 0, 38]

Notice that we use different seeds on each line. This is important! If you reuse
the same seed, you get the same results.

    (x, _) = step (int 0 100) seed0
    (y, _) = step (int 0 100) seed0
    (z, _) = step (int 0 100) seed0
    [x,y,z] -- [85, 85, 85]

As you can see, threading seeds through many calls to `step` is tedious and
error-prone. That's why this library includes many functions to build more
complicated generators, allowing you to call `step` only a small number of
times.

Our example is best written as:

    (values, seed1) = step (list 3 <| int 0 100) seed0
    values -- [85, 0, 38]

-}
step : Generator a -> Seed -> (a, Seed)
step (Generator generator) seed =
  generator seed


{-| Initialize the state of the random number generator. The input should be
a randomly chosen 32-bit integer. You can generate and copy random integers to
create a reproducible psuedo-random generator.

    $ node
    > Math.floor(Math.random()*0xFFFFFFFF)
    227852860

    -- Elm
    seed0 : Seed
    seed0 = initialSeed 227852860

Alternatively, you can generate the random integers on page load and pass them
through a port. The program will be different every time.

    -- Elm
    port randomSeed : Int

    seed0 : Seed
    seed0 = initialSeed randomSeed

    -- JS
    Elm.ModuleName.fullscreen(
      { randomSeed: Math.floor(Math.random()*0xFFFFFFFF) })

Either way, you should initialize a random seed only once. After that, whenever
you use a seed, you'll get another one back.
-}
initialSeed : Int -> Seed
initialSeed x =
    let
        (Seed state1) =
            next (Seed 0)

        state2 =
            Bitwise.shiftRightZfBy 0 (state1 + x)
    in
        next (Seed state2)
