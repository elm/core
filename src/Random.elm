{-| This library helps you generate pseudo-random values. The best way to use
it in your programs probably involves carrying a `Seed` in your application's
state.

Details: This is an implemenation of the Portable Combined Generator of
L'Ecuyer for 32-bit computers. It is almost a direct translation from the
[System.Random](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/random-1.0.1.1/docs/System-Random.html)
module. It has a period of roughly 2.30584e18.

{-| Generate a 32-bit integer in a given range. This function will continue to
produce values outside of the range [minInt, maxInt] but sufficient
randomness is not guaranteed.

      int -5 5   -- an integer between -5 and 5

-- DATA STRUCTURES

{-| Create a pair of random values. A common use of this might be to generate
a point in a certain 2D space. Imagine we have a collage that is 400 pixels
wide and 200 pixels tall.

      randomPoint : Generator (Int,Int)
      randomPoint =
          pair (int -200 200) (int -100 100)

-}
pair : Generator a -> Generator b -> Generator (a,b)
pair genLeft genRight seed =
    let (left , seed' ) = genLeft seed
        (right, seed'') = genRight seed'
    in
        ((left,right), seed'')


{-| Create a list of random values using a generator function.

      floatList : Generator (List Float)
      floatList = list 10 (float 0 1)

      intList : Generator (List Int)
      intList = list 5 (int 0 100)

      intPairs : Generator (List (Int, Int))
      intPairs =
          list 10 (pair int int)
-}
list : Int -> Generator a -> Generator (List a)
list n gen =
    listHelp [] n gen


listHelp : List a -> Int -> Generator a -> Generator (List a)
listHelp list n generate seed =
    if n < 1
    then (List.reverse list, seed)
    else
        let (value, seed') = generate seed
        in  listHelp (value :: list) (n-1) generate seed'

{-| A `Generator` is a function that takes a seed, and then returns a random
value and a new seed. The new seed is used to generate new random values. You
can use this to define Generators of your own. For example, here is how
`pair` is implemented.

      pair : Generator a -> Generator b -> Generator (a,b)
      pair genLeft genRight seed =
          let (left , seed' ) = genLeft seed
              (right, seed'') = genRight seed'
          in
              ((left,right), seed'')
-}
type alias Generator a =
    Seed -> (a, Seed)

type State = State Int Int

type alias Seed =
    { state : State
    , next  : State -> (Int, State)
    , split : State -> (State, State)
    , range : State -> (Int,Int)
    }

{-|The split operation allows one to obtain two distinct random number generators. 
This is very useful in functional programs (for example, when passing a random 
number generator down to recursive calls), but very little work has been done on 
statistically robust implementations of split.
 -}
split : Seed -> (Seed, Seed)
split seed =
    let (state0, state1) = seed.split seed.state
        seed0 = { seed | state <- state0 }
        seed1 = { seed | state <- state1 }
    in (seed0, seed1)

{-| Run a random value generator with a given seed. It will give you back a
random value and a new seed.

      seed0 = initialSeed 42

      -- generate int seed0 ==> (4123, seed1)
      -- generate int seed1 ==> (-123, seed2)
      -- generate int seed2 ==> (1021, seed3)

Notice that we use different seeds on each line. This is important! If you use
the same seed, you get the same results.

      -- generate int seed0 ==> (4123, seed1)
      -- generate int seed0 ==> (4123, seed1)
      -- generate int seed0 ==> (4123, seed1)

{-| Create a &ldquo;seed&rdquo; of randomness which makes it possible to
generate random values. If you use the same seed many times, it will result
in the same thing every time! A good way to get an unexpected seed is to use
the current time.
