{-| This library helps you generate pseudo-random values.

The general pattern is to define a `Generator` which can produce certain kinds
of random values. You actually produce random values by feeding a fresh `Seed`
to your `Generator`.

Since you need a fresh `Seed` to produce more random values, you should
probably store a `Seed` in your application's state. This will allow you to
keep updating it as you generate random values and fresh seeds.

The following example models a bunch of bad guys that randomly appear. The
`possiblyAddBadGuy` function uses the random seed to see if we should add a bad
guy, and if so, it places a bad guy at a randomly generated point.

    type alias Model =
        { badGuys : List (Float,Float)
        , seed : Seed
        }

    possiblyAddBadGuy : Model -> Model
    possiblyAddBadGuy model =
        let (addProbability, seed') =
              generate (float 0 1) model.seed
        in
            if addProbability < 0.9
              then
                { model |
                    seed <- seed'
                }
              else
                let (position, seed'') =
                      generate (pair (float 0 100) (float 0 100)) seed'
                in
                    { model |
                        badGuys <- position :: model.badGuys
                        ,seed <- seed''
                    }

Details: This is an implemenation of the Portable Combined Generator of
L'Ecuyer for 32-bit computers. It is almost a direct translation from the
[System.Random](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/random-1.0.1.1/docs/System-Random.html)
module. It has a period of roughly 2.30584e18.
