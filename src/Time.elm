{-| Type alias to make it clearer when you are working with time values.
Using the `Time` constants instead of raw numbers is very highly recommended.
-}
type alias Time = Float

{-| Units of time, making it easier to specify things like a half-second
`(500 * milliseconds)` without remembering Elm&rsquo;s underlying units of time.
-}
millisecond : Time
millisecond = 1

second : Time
second = 1000 * millisecond

minute : Time
minute = 60 * second

hour : Time
hour = 60 * minute

inMilliseconds : Time -> Float
inMilliseconds t = t

inSeconds : Time -> Float
inSeconds t = t / second

inMinutes : Time -> Float
inMinutes t = t / minute

inHours : Time -> Float
inHours t = t / hour

{-| Takes desired number of frames per second (fps). The resulting signal
gives a sequence of time deltas as quickly as possible until it reaches
the desired FPS. A time delta is the time between the last frame and the
current frame.
-}
fps : number -> Signal Time
fps = Native.Time.fps

{-| Same as the fps function, but you can turn it on and off. Allows you
to do brief animations based on user input without major inefficiencies.
The first time delta after a pause is always zero, no matter how long
the pause was. This way summing the deltas will actually give the amount
of time that the output signal has been running.
-}
fpsWhen : number -> Signal Bool -> Signal Time
fpsWhen = Native.Time.fpsWhen

{-| Takes a time interval t. The resulting signal is the current time, updated
every t.
-}
every : Time -> Signal Time
every = Native.Time.every

{-| Takes a time `t` and any signal. The resulting boolean signal is true for
time `t` after every event on the input signal. So ``(second `since`
Mouse.clicks)`` would result in a signal that is true for one second after
each mouse click and false otherwise.
-}
since : Time -> Signal a -> Signal Bool
since = Native.Time.since

{-| Add a timestamp to any signal. Timestamps increase monotonically. When you
create `(timestamp Mouse.x)`, an initial timestamp is produced. The timestamp
updates whenever `Mouse.x` updates.

Timestamp updates are tied to individual events, so
`(timestamp Mouse.x)` and `(timestamp Mouse.y)` will always have the same
timestamp because they rely on the same underlying event (`Mouse.position`).
-}
timestamp : Signal a -> Signal (Time, a)
timestamp = Native.Time.timestamp

{-| Delay a signal by a certain amount of time. So `(delay second Mouse.clicks)`
will update one second later than any mouse click.
-}
delay : Time -> Signal a -> Signal a
delay = Native.Time.delay
