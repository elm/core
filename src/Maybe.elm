{-| This library fills a bunch of important niches in Elm. A `Maybe` can help
you with optional arguments, error handling, and records with optional fields.

{-| Represent values that may or may not exist. It can be useful if you have a
record field that is only filled in sometimes. Or if a function takes a value
sometimes, but does not absolutely need it.

      -- A person, but maybe we do not know their age.
      type alias Person =
          { name : String
          , age : Maybe Int
          }

      tom = { name = "Tom", age = Just 42 }
      sue = { name = "Sue", age = Nothing }
-}
type Maybe a = Just a | Nothing


{-| Provide a default value, turning an optional value into a normal value.
This comes in handy when paired with functions like `Dict.get` which gives back
a `Maybe`.

    Just 42 ? 100   -- 42
    Nothing ? 100   -- 100

    Dict.get "Tom" Dict.empty ? "unknown"   -- "unknown"

It is defined so you can try a bunch of different things before getting to
the default.

    Nothing ? Just 42 ? 100   -- 42

    Dict.get "Tom" occupations
      ? Dict.get "Tom" jobs
      ? "unknown"

{-| Pick the first `Maybe` that actually has a value. Useful when you want to
try a couple different things, but there is no default value.

    oneOf [ Nothing, Just 42, Just 71 ] == Just 42
    oneOf [ Nothing, Nothing, Just 71 ] == Just 71
    oneOf [ Nothing, Nothing, Nothing ] == Nothing

oneOf : List (Maybe a) -> Maybe a
oneOf maybes =
  case maybes of
    [] ->
        Nothing

        case maybe of
          Nothing -> oneOf rest
          Just _ -> maybe


{-| Transform an `Maybe` value with a given function:

      map sqrt (Just 9) == Just 3
      map sqrt Nothing == Nothing
-}
map : (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> Maybe b
map f maybe =
    case maybe of
      Just value -> Just (f value)
      Nothing -> Nothing


{-| Chain together many computations that may fail. It is helpful to see its
definition:

      andThen : Maybe a -> (a -> Maybe b) -> Maybe b
      andThen maybe callback =
          case maybe of
            Just value -> callback value
            Nothing -> Nothing

This means we only continue with the callback if things are going well. For
example, say you need to use (`toInt : String -> Maybe Int`) to parse a month
and make sure it is between 1 and 12:

      toValidMonth : Int -> Maybe Int
      toValidMonth month =
          if month >= 1 && month <= 12
              then Just month
              else Nothing

      toMonth : String -> Maybe Int
      toMonth rawString =
          toInt rawString `andThen` toValidMonth

If `toInt` fails and results in `Nothing` this entire chain of operations will
short-circuit and result in `Nothing`. If `toValidMonth` results in `Nothing`,
again the chain of computations will result in `Nothing`.
