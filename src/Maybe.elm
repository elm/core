{-| This library fills a bunch of important niches in Elm. A `Maybe` can help
you with optional arguments, error handling, and records with optional fields.

{-| Represent values that may or may not exist. It can be useful if you have a
record field that is only filled in sometimes. Or if a function takes a value
sometimes, but does not absolutely need it.

    -- A person, but maybe we do not know their age.
    type alias Person =
        { name : String
        , age : Maybe Int
        }

    tom = { name = "Tom", age = Just 42 }
    sue = { name = "Sue", age = Nothing }
-}
type Maybe a
    = Just a
    | Nothing


{-| Provide a default value, turning an optional value into a normal
value.  This comes in handy when paired with functions like
[`Dict.get`](Dict#get) which gives back a `Maybe`.

    withDefault 100 (Just 42)   -- 42
    withDefault 100 Nothing     -- 100

    withDefault "unknown" (Dict.get "Tom" Dict.empty)   -- "unknown"

-}
withDefault : a -> Maybe a -> a
withDefault default maybe =
    case maybe of
      Just value -> value
      Nothing -> default


{-| Pick the first `Maybe` that actually has a value. Useful when you want to
try a couple different things, but there is no default value.

    oneOf [ Nothing, Just 42, Just 71 ] == Just 42
    oneOf [ Nothing, Nothing, Just 71 ] == Just 71
    oneOf [ Nothing, Nothing, Nothing ] == Nothing

{-| Apply a function if all the arguments are `Just` a value.

    map2 (+) (Just 3) (Just 4) == Just 7
    map2 (+) (Just 3) Nothing == Nothing
    map2 (+) Nothing (Just 4) == Nothing

{-| Chain together many computations that may fail. It is helpful to see its
definition:

    andThen : Maybe a -> (a -> Maybe b) -> Maybe b
    andThen maybe callback =
        case maybe of
            Just value ->
                callback value

            Nothing ->
                Nothing

This means we only continue with the callback if things are going well. For
example, say you need to use (`head : List Int -> Maybe Int`) to get the
first month from a `List` and then make sure it is between 1 and 12:

    toValidMonth : Int -> Maybe Int
    toValidMonth month =
        if month >= 1 && month <= 12 then
            Just month
        else
            Nothing

    getFirstMonth : List Int -> Maybe Int
    getFirstMonth months =
        head months `andThen` toValidMonth

If `head` fails and results in `Nothing` (because the `List` was `empty`),
this entire chain of operations will short-circuit and result in `Nothing`.
If `toValidMonth` results in `Nothing`, again the chain of computations
will result in `Nothing`.

andThen : Maybe a -> (a -> Maybe b) -> Maybe b

        Just value -> callback value
