{-| Create a list with only one element:

    singleton 1234 == [1234]
    singleton "hi" == ["hi"]
-}
singleton : a -> List a
singleton value =
  [value]


{-| Create a list with *n* copies of a value:

    repeat 3 (0,0) == [(0,0),(0,0),(0,0)]
-}
repeat : Int -> a -> List a
repeat n value =
  repeatHelp [] n value


repeatHelp : List a -> Int -> a -> List a
repeatHelp result n value =
  if n <= 0 then
    result

  else
    repeatHelp (cons value result) (n-1) value


{-| Create a list of numbers, every element increasing by one.
You give the lowest and highest number that should be in the list.

    range 3 6 == [3, 4, 5, 6]
    range 3 3 == [3]
    range 6 3 == []
-}

rangeHelp lo hi list =
  if lo <= hi then

{-| Add an element to the front of a list.

    1 :: [2,3] == [1,2,3]
    1 :: [] == [1]

This operator is pronounced *cons* for historical reasons, but you can think
of it like pushing an entry onto a stack.

-- TRANSFORM


{-| Apply a function to every element of a list.

    map sqrt [1,4,9] == [1,2,3]

    map not [True,False,True] == [False,True,False]

So `map func [ a, b, c ]` is the same as `[ func a, func b, func c ]`
-}
map : (a -> b) -> List a -> List b
map f xs =
  foldr (\x acc -> cons (f x) acc) [] xs


{-| Same as `map` but the function is also applied to the index of each
element (starting at zero).

    indexedMap Tuple.pair ["Tom","Sue","Bob"] == [ (0,"Tom"), (1,"Sue"), (2,"Bob") ]

{-| Reduce a list from the left.

    foldl (+)  0  [1,2,3] == 6
    foldl (::) [] [1,2,3] == [3,2,1]

So `foldl step state [1,2,3]` is like saying:
